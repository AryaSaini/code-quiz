## About This Project 
```
In this project we had to create a quiz with a timer that gave you a final score when you finished the quiz. We had to reinforce a lot of javascript skills that we learned as well as learning how to store things in a local storage and how to pull the information out of it. I had some challenges in displaying the scores in an order from highest to lowest.
